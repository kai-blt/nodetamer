# Node Tamer
A tool to help visualize linked lists, trees and graphs made in React! During my studies at Lambda School I really wanted a tool that would help me visualize nodes and their relationships and this tool is the result.

## Tech
Build with React, Draggable, XArrows and Styled-Components
 
## Features
* add nodes via simple keyboard input
* add relationships between nodes using >, <, and &
* drag nodes anywhere on the canvas for different graphical representation
* mark nodes with a different color by shift-clicking on a node
